Law Enforcement systems

## TODO:

- [ ] DEMS: Digitel Evidence Management System  
  - [ ] Community access to non-sensitive cases
  - [ ] Ability for community uploaded evidence review to allow crucial pieces of information to be uploaded and added to cases by community
    - This ties into the CRS below and can be offered as a service by the DEMS but have a facade in the CRS.
    - Having ties to the community and POCs in the community is crucial for police to be able to effectively collect, retain and get evolving evidence and upates.
- [ ] CMS: Case Management System  
- [ ] CRS: Crime Reporting System  
- [ ] Other Services in relation  
- [ ] **Some sort of AI or ML that can take in a description / case, look at the facts, and determine the charges and laws involved**
